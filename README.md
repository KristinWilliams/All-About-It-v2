# All About it 

This is a multi page react app made for J.R Brown. It has a books page, a contact page, an about page and a blog page. The books page features a buy button that links to the amazon page and a read more button that opens a modal describing the books. The contact page features a suggestions form, where people can leave suggestions for the blog and the messages are sent to J.R Brown's email. The blog page has data coming from strapi's api that automatically gets updated when a J.R Brown adds a new blog post.
